   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br>
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br>
   and conversions to other media types.<br>

   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
   &#34;Derivative Works&#34; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>

   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>

   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
   &#34;Contribution&#34; shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>

   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>

   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
   as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
   meet the following conditions:<br>
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
       stating that You changed the files; and<br>
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
       the Derivative Works; and<br>
   (d) If the Work includes a &#34;NOTICE&#34; text file as part of its<br>
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
       as modifying the License.<br>
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
   the conditions stated in this License.<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#34;AS IS&#34; BASIS,<br>
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
